PIIN intro
----------
- *PIIN theory incl T/tauC relation*
- *past efforts in NIR: had to reduce spectral width to increase coherence time*


PIIN from visible LED light
===========================

motivate experiment in visible:
------------------------------
- *LEDs easier than SLEDs, also more powerful cheaper LEDs available*
- *CMOS not fast enough, need SPAD arrays*
- *(SPAD arrays getting cheaper in CMOS processes)*
- *need some sources for recent SPAD array developments*
- *Sanguinetti: mobile phone camera shot noise*
- *will measure shot noise too: extend measured noise level of Sanguinetti scheme*
- *proof of principle: see difference in noise level between low coherence (PIIN too fast) and longer coherence (PIIN visible)*

- *SPAD saturation issue: need to stay in quasi-linear regime*
- export saturation curve in high resolution from Matlab (and recalculate including higher order Poisson terms):

Set-up 1: pulsed LED
--------------------
	- *T given by pulse length*
	- *high dark counts*
	- low collection efficiency due to low fill factor (need MLA)
	- expensive pulsed LED as T is only determined by pulse length so tight requirements on pulse length

Set-up 2: CW LED & gated detection
----------------------------------
	- cheaper as only need camera & FPGA (both can be integrated on microcircuits)
	- through combination of ext gate and SW gate can achieve shorter T
	- low dark counts

	- maxRate given by 1/deadTime as pixels are continuously counting, therefore max signal is T x maxRate
	- max LED power limited by damage current threshold

Set-up 3: pulsed LED & gated detection
--------------------------------------
	- addresses maxRate and damage threshold issue
	- pulse length of LED not as critical - can use cheaper components
	- need to match electronic delays
	- final version use LED pulse width as well as gates to get ultra short effective T

Future prospects/integration
============================

- faster LED rise times enable shorter T - from plasmonic LED paper
- LED array through diffuser & filter onto SPAD array
- bigger faster cheaper SPAD arrays with timetagging
