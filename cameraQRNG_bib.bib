	abstract = {Random numbers are a valuable component in diverse applications that range from simulations1 over gambling to cryptography2,3. The quest for true randomness in these applications has engendered a large variety of different proposals for producing random numbers based on the foundational unpredictability of quantum mechanics4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, most approaches do not consider that a potential adversary could have knowledge about the generated numbers, so the numbers are not verifiably random and unique12,13,14,15. Here we present a simple experimental setup based on homodyne measurements that uses the purity of a continuous-variable quantum vacuum state to generate unique random numbers. We use the intrinsic randomness in measuring the quadratures of a mode in the lowest energy vacuum state, which cannot be correlated to any other state. The simplicity of our source, combined with its verifiably unique randomness, are important attributes for achieving high-reliability, high-speed and low-cost quantum random number generators.},

	abstract = {We describe a methodology and standard of proof for experimental claims of quantum random-number generation (QRNG), analogous to well-established methods from precision measurement. For appropriately constructed physical implementations, lower bounds on the quantum contribution to the average min-entropy can be derived from measurements on the QRNG output. Given these bounds, randomness extractors allow generation of nearly perfect “ε-random” bit streams. An analysis of experimental uncertainties then gives experimentally derived confidence levels on the ε randomness of these sequences. We demonstrate the methodology by application to phase-diffusion QRNG, driven by spontaneous emission as a trusted randomness source. All other factors, including classical phase noise, amplitude fluctuations, digitization errors, and correlations due to finite detection bandwidth, are treated with paranoid caution, i.e., assuming the worst possible behaviors consistent with observations. A data-constrained numerical optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound the average min-entropy. Under this paranoid analysis, the QRNG remains efficient, generating at least 2.3 quantum random bits per symbol with 8-bit digitization and at least 0.83 quantum random bits per symbol with binary digitization at a confidence level of 0.999 93. The result demonstrates ultrafast QRNG with strong experimental guarantees.},

By using a straightforward conﬁguration we experimentally prove that the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission noise of an optical ampliﬁer—either an Er -doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA) or an InGaAs semiconductor optical ampliﬁer (SOA)—is an efﬁcient source for TRBS generation. A bit rate up to 560 Gb/s has been recorded, seeded by the direct detection of the unﬁltered spontaneous-spontaneous (sp-sp) optical intensity beat noise on a broadband photoreceiver. The generation rate is practically limited only by the detection bandwidth, the electronic digitization process and the post-processing circuitry. The proposed mechanism passes the existing benchmarks of randomness.},

Ampliﬁed spontaneous emission noise is generated in the SLD and chaotic intensity ﬂuctuation is generated in a semiconductor laser. We investigate the performance of random number generation for both optical sources. For single-bit generation of random numbers, the maximum generation rate is 8.33 Gb/s for both the SLD and the laser with a similar bandwidth of ∼15 GHz. For multibit generation schemes, we obtain the generation rate up to 400 Gb/s for both the SLD and the laser. The overall characteristics are similar between the SLD and the laser, since similar bandwidths of the RF spectra are used. The probability density function of the SLD is more symmetric than that of the chaotic laser. This fact results in slightly good performance of random number generation using the SLD for multibit generation.},

Utilizing the delayed selfdifference technique to improve the symmetry of filtered ASE, we experimentally achieve real-time 2.5-Gbit/s random sequence generation, which matches with the speeds of fiber communication for one-time pad encryption. Experimental results show that the generated random sequences can pass NIST tests as long as the delay time is beyond a threshold value, which is called the minimum delay time (MDT). Further simulation results indicate that there is a certain relationship between the MDT and bandwidth of the ASE signal.},

Moreover, we consider a potential adversary who has partial knowledge on the raw data and discuss how one can rigorously remove such partial knowledge with postprocessing. We quantify the quantum randomness through min-entropy by modeling our system and employ two randomness extractors - Trevisan’s extractor and Toeplitz-hashing - to distill the randomness, which is information-theoretically provable.
