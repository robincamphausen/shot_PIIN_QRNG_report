The quest for true randomness in these applications has engendered a large variety of different proposals for producing random numbers based on the foundational unpredictability of quantum mechanics4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. However, most approaches do not consider that a potential adversary could have knowledge about the generated numbers, so the numbers are not verifiably random and unique12,13,14,15. Here we present a simple experimental setup based on homodyne measurements that uses the purity of a continuous-variable quantum vacuum state to generate unique random numbers. We use the intrinsic randomness in measuring the quadratures of a mode in the lowest energy vacuum state, which cannot be correlated to any other state. The simplicity of our source, combined with its verifiably unique randomness, are important attributes for achieving high-reliability, high-speed and low-cost quantum random number generators.},

	abstract = {We describe a methodology and standard of proof for experimental claims of quantum random-number generation (QRNG), analogous to well-established methods from precision measurement. For appropriately constructed physical implementations, lower bounds on the quantum contribution to the average min-entropy can be derived from measurements on the QRNG output. Given these bounds, randomness extractors allow generation of nearly perfect “ε-random” bit streams. An analysis of experimental uncertainties then gives experimentally derived confidence levels on the ε randomness of these sequences. We demonstrate the methodology by application to phase-diffusion QRNG, driven by spontaneous emission as a trusted randomness source. All other factors, including classical phase noise, amplitude fluctuations, digitization errors, and correlations due to finite detection bandwidth, are treated with paranoid caution, i.e., assuming the worst possible behaviors consistent with observations. A data-constrained numerical optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound the average min-entropy. Under this paranoid analysis, the QRNG remains efficient, generating at least 2.3 quantum random bits per symbol with 8-bit digitization and at least 0.83 quantum random bits per symbol with binary digitization at a confidence level of 0.999 93. The result demonstrates ultrafast QRNG with strong experimental guarantees.},

A bit rate up to 560 Gb/s has been recorded, seeded by the direct detection of the unﬁltered spontaneous-spontaneous (sp-sp) optical intensity beat noise on a broadband photoreceiver.

For single-bit generation of random numbers, the maximum generation rate is 8.33 Gb/s for both the SLD and the laser with a similar bandwidth of ∼15 GHz. For multibit generation schemes, we obtain the generation rate up to 400 Gb/s for both the SLD and the laser. The overall characteristics are similar between the SLD and the laser, since similar bandwidths of the RF spectra are used. The probability density function of the SLD is more symmetric than that of the chaotic laser. This fact results in slightly good performance of random number generation using the SLD for multibit generation.},

Experimental results show that the generated random sequences can pass NIST tests as long as the delay time is beyond a threshold value, which is called the minimum delay time (MDT).

Moreover, we consider a potential adversary who has partial knowledge on the raw data and discuss how one can rigorously remove such partial knowledge with postprocessing. We quantify the quantum randomness through min-entropy by modeling our system and employ two randomness extractors - Trevisan’s extractor and Toeplitz-hashing - to distill the randomness, which is information-theoretically provable.

Gain switching at few-GHz frequencies produces a train of bright pulses with nearly equal amplitudes and random phases. An unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used to interfere subsequent pulses and thereby generate strong random-amplitude pulses, which are detected and digitized to produce a high-rate random bit string. Using established models of semiconductor laser ﬁeld dynamics, we predict a regime of high visibility interference and nearly complete vacuum-ﬂuctuation-induced phase diffusion between pulses. These are conﬁrmed by measurement of pulse power statistics at the output of the interferometer. Using a 5.825 GHz excitation rate and 14-bit digitization, we observe 43 Gbps quantum randomness generation.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in the design and realization of optical antennas enclosing fluorescent materials has demonstrated large spontaneous-emission enhancements and, simultaneously, high radiation efficiencies. We discuss here that an important objective of such work is to increase spontaneous-emission rates to such a degree that light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can possess modulation speeds exceeding those of typical semiconductor lasers, which are usually in the range {\textasciitilde}20-50 GHz. We outline the underlying physics that enable large spontaneous-emission enhancements in metallic nanostructures, and we then discuss recent theoretical and experimentally promising results, where enhancements larger than a factor of {\textasciitilde}300 have been reported, with radiation efficiencies exceeding 50\%. We provide key comparative advantages of these structures in comparison to conventional dielectric microcavity designs, namely the fact that the enhancement of spontaneous emission can be relatively nonresonant (i.e., broadband) and that the antenna nanostructures can be spectrally and structurally compatible for integration with a wide class of emitters, including organic dyes, diamond nanocrystals and colloidal quantum dots. Finally, we point out that physical insight into the underlying effects can be gained by analyzing these metallic nanostructures in their equivalent-circuit (or nano-antenna) model, showing that all main effects (including the Purcell factor) can adequately be described in that approach.},

	abstract = {SPAD (single-photon avalanche diode) arrays are single-photon imagers that can provide unparalleled timeresolved sensing performance. Since their inception in standard CMOS technologies (2003), a host of architectures and target applications have been explored, ranging from simple pixel arrays, with off-chip data processing electronics, to fully integrated “smart” imagers with in-pixel time-stamping electronics and/or on-chip data processing fabric. Applications include (endoscopic) FLIM, (multi-beam multiphoton) FLIM-FRET, SPIMFCS, time-resolved Raman, NIROT, super-resolution microscopy, and PET, to name a few. We will review some representative sensors and applications, the corresponding challenges, and provide an outlook on the future of this fascinating technology},
